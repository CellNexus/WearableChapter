A wearable device is often used for tracking a wearer’s vital signs or health and fitness related data, location, etc. The healthcare space is going through a digital revolution with the invasion of technology. Medical wearables with artificial intelligence and big data are providing an added value to healthcare with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, patient monitoring and prevention. Wearable devices applied to healthcare offer multiple advantages to healthcare professionals as well as the patients:

    <li>
      <strong>Personalization</strong>The doctor, with the help of a software can quickly create a program based on the needs of the patient.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Early diagnosis.</strong>Precise medical parameters in the wearable devices allow early detection of symptoms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Remote patient monitoring.</strong> Healthcare professionals can monitor patients remotely and in real-time through the use of wearable devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adherence to medication.</strong>Wearable devices help patient to take medications on time and even inform medical professionals if the patient fails to adhere to medications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Information registry.</strong> The data are stored in real-time, allowing a more exhaustive analysis of the information. This results in a more complete and precise report on the patient’s medical history, which can be shared with other medical specialists.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Optimum decision by the doctor.</strong> The doctor is able to compare and analyze data to make a sharper clinical decision to enhance the patient’s quality of life.
