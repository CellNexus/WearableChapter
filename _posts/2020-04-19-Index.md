<blockquote class="tip"><strong>Wearable technology in healthcare </strong> earable technology in healthcare includes electronic devices that consumers can wear, like Fitbits and smartwatches, and are designed to collect the data of users' personal health and exercise.

The technology revolution in the miniaturization of electronic devices is enabling to design more reliable and adaptable wearables, contributing for a world-wide change in the health monitoring approach.

Wearables have been adopted in a wide range of fields; however, they have their greatest potential in healthcare to address spiralling healthcare costs, aging populations, and the burden of chronic disease.

The advancement of wearable technology and growing demand from consumers to take control of their own health has influenced the medical industry, including insurers, providers, and technology companies, to develop more wearable devices.
